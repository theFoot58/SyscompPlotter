# SyscompPlotter
create PDF files with plots found in .csv files generated by the SysComp CircuitGear V2.15 Net analysis cmd

A Canadian company called SysComp makes a very cool virtual oscillicsope they call the Sig-101.  
It has what they call a network analysis mode,  if you build a proper exciter coil and hook things up properly 
you can test the frequency response of guitar pickups,  or any coil of wire.

The Sig-101 is a hardware box with a USB connector,  and a software program,  CircuitGear.  You can use CircuitGear 
to run the Network Analysis,  which runs the output (the exciter coil) through a sweep of frequencies,  
measuring the response coil under test.   There is an 'Export waveform to CSV' command,  which will generate 
a csv file with hundreds of rows with two values each,  freuquency (in Hz)  and response (in dB).  

This program takes a number of csv files,  each of which contain the frequency response of a coil, and plots them
so they can be compared.

It is a ruby program,  so you will have to have ruby installed.  

You run it thusly:

ruby coiltool.rb file1 file2 ... file6

each file is a csv file generated by the Export caoomand,  you leave off the '.csv'

it generates out.pdf in the current directory with your plot

This program requires the Prawn gem.  To install:

gem install prawn
